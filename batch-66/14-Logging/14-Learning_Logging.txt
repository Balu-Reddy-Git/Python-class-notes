Logging - event driven capturing of errors is called logging.

log4j - logging module -> perl/java.

References:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html

Functions  for logging:

- debug(),info(),warning(),error(),critical()

- print -> print is for printing on the screen/console.
- debug() -> granular representation of events from the start to the event generation.
- info() -> for every event we get a information.
- warning() -> for generating the warning messages. ( my disk is gone bad. It wont stop the application.)
- error() -> we have a issue with our application. ( not the whole application but part of application is down.)
- critcal() -> our application is badly affected. (our whole application may be down.)

# for every function we have a level.
